there
was
light
and
the
darkness
that
followed
blinded
eyes
the
night
made
trustworthy
and
hid
all
lies
called
the
seventh
the
eight
and
gave
him
offer
cold
were
the
feelings
bore
inside
after
lost
her
sometimes
still
can
hear
his
voices
calling
calling
from
everywhere
and
now
and
then
feel
soul
slowly
slipping
out
myself
into
his
hell
close
eyes
and
makes
forget
tell
her
the
deal
and
the
conditions
met
and
now
far
too
late
tell
her
what
going
here
somehow
almost
looking
forward
when
this
over
felt
ghost
cross
over
and
knew
was
near
and
across
the
river
could
see
him
standing
there
solo
and
there
was
light
and
the
blackness
that
followed
blinded
her
eyes
the
night
drew
her
and
met
the
dark
and
this
why
here
were
the
words
that
she
said
kiss
told
her
was
responsible
for
her
being
dead
she
cried
silence
and
wiped
away
her
tears
she
felt
cold
hand
amplifying
her
fears
she
knew
where
she
was
and
she
cursed
her
beloved
and
all
sudden
all
was
over
sometimes
still
can
hear
his
voices
calling
calling
from
everywhere
and
now
and
then
feel
soul
slowly
slipping
out
myself
into
his
hell
know
waiting
there
for
his
limbo
between
destination
and
reality

had
already

day
opened
the
big
wooden
door
and
stepped
out
the
shadows
the
sun
had
shown
behind
the
eastern
forest
bright
and
warm
cloudless
sky
his
eyes
closed
slowly
raised
his
head
gently
the
morning
wind
caressed
his
face
and
rustled
through
his
long
hair
the
chatter
the
birds
had
become
one
with
the
whispers
the
black
elders
melding
with
the
rhythmic
babbling
the
little
brook
which
wound
its
way
the
distance
behind
the
humble
grange
but
has
not
always
been
like
that
one

cut
down
where
they
stood
the
cold
crisp
autumn
night
the
ones
who
still
had
life
their
veins
escaped
despair
but
regathered
quickly
and
formed
resistance
many
among
them
women
and
children
only
armed
with
axes
torches
and
pitchforks
and
seemed
all
hope
was
forsaken

nothing
left
you
when
left
the
loop
what
were
you
trying
prove
you
skin
and
bones

weaker
one
one
gaze
into
the

cold
the
